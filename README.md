# Data Analytics Project — End-to-End Data Insights
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from data loading and exploration in Python to dashboard creation and business insights presentation.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data through analysis, visualization, and reporting.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about (mention dataset briefly — e.g., customer behavior, sales performance, Airbnb listings, etc.).

Format: .csv

Key attributes include (list a few key columns — e.g., customer_id, purchase_amount, date, region).

Size: (e.g., ~10,000 rows and 12 columns)
Steps Followed
# 1. Data Loading and Cleaning (Python)

Imported dataset using Pandas.

Checked for null values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types.

Performed data cleaning: handling missing values, formatting columns, and removing outliers.

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics and data distributions.

Visualized relationships and patterns using bar charts, heatmaps, and histograms.

Identified key trends and anomalies for deeper analysis.

# 3. SQL Integration

Imported the cleaned dataset into MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server.

Ran SQL queries to extract insights, perform joins, aggregations, and filtering.

Example queries:

Top 10 performing categories or regions

Monthly or yearly sales trend

Customer retention or churn analysis

# 4. Power BI Dashboard

Connected SQL database to Power BI.

Built interactive visual dashboards showing key metrics, KPIs, and insights.

Added filters, slicers, and drill-through functionalities for better interactivity.

# 5. Final Report & Presentation (Gamma)

Summarized insights and visualizations into a professional Gamma presentation.
Dashboard Highlights

Interactive visualizations for better storytelling.

Key metrics such as Total Revenue, Top Performing Categories, Customer Growth, and Regional Insights.

User-friendly layout with dynamic filters.

Highlighted findings, business recommendations, and actionable insights.
